Introduction
============

Natural disturbance trough treefall is a main factor of forest dynamic (Veblen [1992](#ref-Veblen1992)). Still, climate and human activities are also at the origin of forest disturbances, with huge and underevaluated impacts. Human-induced forest disturbances will result either in forest degradation or in deforestation. Degradation has met numerous definitions (Simula [2009](#ref-Simula2009)), but can be defined as the result from a disturbance event that induced a modification of the forest ecosystem reducing ecosystem services while keeping the ecosystem as a forest, contrary to deforestation. Degradation can be the result of forest logging and management, whereas deforestation can be realized through total afforestation or fragmentation resulting in land use change. Pearson *et al.* ([2017](#ref-Pearson2017)) encompassed selective timber harvest in native forests, woodfuel harvest and fire in tropical forest degradation. Tropical forests disturbances, through deforestation and degradation, account for 8.26 billion of tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year (Pearson *et al.* [2017](#ref-Pearson2017)). It represents the third source of greenhouse gas. Besides deforestation has been rightly the focus of worldwide attention, degradation has been less studied and quantified through tropics. Degradation from forest has been estimated to represents 10 time the deforestation area (Herold *et al.* [2011](#ref-Herold2011)) and represents 20% of greenhouse gas emissions in the Brazilian Amazon (Asner *et al.* [2005](#ref-Asner2005)). In addition to the direct impact of human on forests, a more insidious disturbance is climate change (Hérault & Gourlet-Fleury [2016](#ref-Herault2016)).

Regarding deforestation, the ecosystem response to land use change is almost absent due to the negative feedback of the new ecosystem state after the tipping point was reached. Consequently, ecosystem response to disturbance should be studied in the different contexts of forest degradation. Concerning timber and woodfuel harvest, Avila *et al.* ([2015](#ref-DeAvila2015)) found that additional sylvicultural practices and logging damages had stronger negative effect on diversity than logging itself. Carreño-Rocabado *et al.* ([2012](#ref-Carreno-Rocabado2012)) found no direct effect of medium intensity logging on species diversity but a community drift towards 'fast' acquisitive species (Reich [2014](#ref-reich_world-wide_2014)). However, even the short term impact on biodiversity is unclear, as sometimes short term increases in diversity can occur at low sylvicultural intensities (Martin *et al.* [2015](#ref-Martin2015)). Forest fires have been shown to increase pioneers abundance, and if recurrent, to impoverish the forests in the eastern Amazon (Cochrane & Schulze [1999](#ref-Cochrane1999a)). Finally, climate change effect on tropical areas results in a significant risk of precipitation decrease (Davidson *et al.* [2012](#ref-Davidson2012)). In addition, intense drought events has been shown to result in huge mortality rates and biomass loss (Phillips *et al.* [2009](#ref-Phillips2009)).

Tropical rainforests have fascinated ecologists due to their outstanding diversity (Connell [1978](#ref-connell_diversity_1978)). Effectively tropical forests host over half of the Earth's biodiversity (Scheffers *et al.* [2012](#ref-Scheffers2012)). High biodiversity from tropical rainforests is the source of many ecosystem functions. Among others, tropical forests play a key role in biogeochemical cycles, including carbon storage (Lewis *et al.* [2004](#ref-Lewis2004)). Ecosystem functions from tropical forests support numerous ecosystem services, such as timber production and climate regulation.

The question of disturbance impact on tropical forest can be directly related to the emerging field of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (Loreau [2000](#ref-Loreau2000)). Tropical forest outstanding biodiversity will be both a factor and a result of forest ecosystem response to disturbance. And forest ecosystem response to disturbance will directly modify ecosystem functioning in both short and long term. Consequently assessing disturbance effect on tropical forest linking diversity and ecosystem functioning seems an obvious and promising way (Loreau [2010](#ref-Loreau2010)).

Negative short term impacts of disturbances have been assessed for logging, fires and droughts ; but much less is known about the long term impact (Osazuwa-Peters *et al.* [2015](#ref-Osazuwa-Peters2015)). The main reason is the difficulty to conduct long term empirical study (but see Herault *et al.* [2010](#ref-Herault2010)), which can be completed by the use of forest simulators (Huth *et al.* [2004](#ref-Huth2004); Köhler & Huth [2004](#ref-Khler2004); Tietjen & Huth [2006](#ref-Tietjen2006); Rüger *et al.* [2008](#ref-Ruger2008)). Individual-based models of forest dynamics present the perfect framework to develop such joint biodiversity-ecosystem approaches (Maréchaux & Chave [2017](#ref-Marechaux2017)). Individual-based models describe forest accumulating carbon through time, assessing tree growth, or releasing carbon through gap opening (Bugmann [2001](#ref-Bugmann2001)). Up to several dozens of different Plant Functional Types (PFTs) are generally defined and models can sometimes be fully spatially explicit (Pacala *et al.* [1996](#ref-Pacala1996)). Recently, the forest growth simulator TROLL (Chave [1999](#ref-Chave1999)), an individual-based and spatially explicit forest model, was developed to introduce recent advances in plant ecophysiology. TROLL model relates physiological processes to species-specific functional traits (Maréchaux & Chave [2017](#ref-Marechaux2017)). Consequently, TROLL model allow to simulate fully a neotropical forest biodiversity to study biodiversity-ecosystem functioning link response to a disturbance.

We decided to use the forest model TROLL to study the role of biodiversity in forest ecosystem answer to disturbance. Resilience encompass several definitions but was summarized by Oliver *et al.* ([2015](#ref-Oliver2015)) as the degree of resistance or fast recovery from an ecosystem function to environmental disturbance.

Our work is based on the general hypothesis of a positive relationships between biodiversity and productivity. We assumed that when a disturbance event happen, due to a higher productivity, forest with an increased diversity will recover quicker and thus be more resilient, besides other mechanisms could be involved in an increased resilience from diverse forest. This theoretical expectation stand on two processes: complementarity and selection effects (Loreau & Hector [2001](#ref-Loreau2001)). If we take a species pool with different productivity in monoculture, their assemblage will allow them an overall higher productivity due to a better resources acquisition through resources partitioning and niche differentiation. Additionally, some species will individually have an higher productivity in the assemblage than in monoculture due to facilitation from other species present in the assemblage. Complementarity effect is the addition of the better resource acquisition and the facilitation. Now if we look at the evolution of the species assemblage over time, more competitive species will progressively dominate through competitive selection. And if competitive species are more productive, they will increase assemblage overall productivity. This resources preemption by more competitive species is the selection effect. Moreover, we expect the sampling effect to improve resilience of species-rich forests. A bigger initial sampling of the regional species pool in a rich forest, will allow more redundancy and a lower risk to lose important functional traits assemblages for the ecosystem when the disturbance happen.

Generally, positive relationship between biodiversity and productivity were empirically and experimentally demonstrated on grassland systems (Loreau *et al.* [2001](#ref-Loreau2001a); Naeem *et al.* [2002](#ref-Naeem2002); Hooper *et al.* [2005](#ref-Hooper2005a)); but few studies focused on the case of forests. One of the few studies was realized by Chisholm *et al.* ([2013](#ref-Chisholm2013)) and has shown a positive significative relationship between species richness and wood productivity on a worldwide forest network. But those study still presents three major limits: (1) study time are inferior to a tree life time, (2) experimental network include scarcely disturbed plot, and (3) correlative approach does not explain mechanisms involved in the relationship.

We suggest to use a process-based model to overcome those limitations because TROLL model have the same key features that Morin *et al.* ([2011](#ref-Morin2011)): (i) TROLL has been developed and validated independently from the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning issue, (ii) TROLL use 163 real tropical tree species characterized by their functional traits, (iii) TROLL allows to study long term effects with realized species richness for several centuries, (iv) TROLL allows to explore more species associations than real experiments, (v) TROLL allows to explore process resulting in observed relations. In addition, TROLL has been designed to be used in species-rich ecosystems such as tropical rainforests.

In the present study, we focused on mechanisms involved in the relationship between biodiversity and forest ecosystem resilience. We used a simulation approach using TROLL model to assess long term processes for different levels of disturbances. We first assessed diversity effect on forest resilience of structure and functioning using numerous indices of taxonomic and functional diversities. Then, we measured biodiversity net effect, partitioned into complementarity and selection effects, on resilience for several ecosystem metrics.

Material and Methods
====================

Model
-----

TROLL model each tree individually in a located environment. Thus TROLL model, alongside with SORTIE (Pacala *et al.* [1996](#ref-Pacala1996); Uriarte *et al.* [2009](#ref-Uriarte2009)) and FORMIND (Köhler & Huth [1998](#ref-Kohler1998); Fischer *et al.* [2016](#ref-Fischer2016)), can be defined as an individual-based and spatially explicit forest growth model. TROLL simulates the life cycle of individual trees from recruitment, with a diameter at breast height (dbh) above 1 cm, to death with growth and seed production. Trees are growing in a spatialized light environment explicitly computed within voxels of 1 *m*<sup>3</sup>. Each tree is consistently defined by its age, diameter at breast height (dbh), height (h), crown radius (CR), crown depth (CD) and leaf area (LA). Tree geometry is calculated with allometric equations but leaf area vary dynamically within each crown following carbon allocations. Voxels resolution of 1 *m*<sup>3</sup> allow the establishment of maximum one tree by 1x1 m pixels. Each tree is flagged with a species label inherited from the parent tree through the seedling recruitment. A species label is associated to a number of species specific parameters (see table @ref(tab:traits)) related to functional trait values which can be sampled on the field. Carbon assimilation is computed over half-hourly period of a representative day. Then allocation is computed to simulate tree growth from an explicit carbon balance (in contrast to previous models). Finally environment is updated at each time step set to one month. Seedlings are not simulated explicitly but as a pool. In addition below-ground processes, herbaceous plants, epiphytes and lianas are not simulated inside TROLL. The source code is written in C++ and available upon request. All modules of TROLL models are further detailed in Maréchaux & Chave ([2017](#ref-Marechaux2017)).

Previous implementation of TROLL model used Reich *et al.* ([1991](#ref-Reich1991a)) allometry to infer leaf lifespan *L**L* from species leaf mass per area *L**M**A* (Maréchaux & Chave [2017](#ref-Marechaux2017)). But the use of the allometrie from Reich *et al.* ([1991](#ref-Reich1991a)) with current implementation of the TROLL model resulted in an underestimation of leaf lifespan for low LMA species. Consequently we designed our own leaf lifespan allometry, specific to tropical tree species, to be used in subsequent analysis (see supplementary materials S1).

We decided to explore the resilience of forest ecosystem following a generic disturbance. Disturbance module inside TROLL was designed in the simplest way in order to relate the ecosystem answer to volume loss without any individuals nor species targeting. For a given iteration *d**i**s**t**u**r**b*<sub>*i**t**e**r*</sub>, individuals are picked randomly with a uniform law on the number of trees. Selected individuals are then removed without triggering a treefall to avoid any side effect. The operation is repeated until the disturbance result in a defined lost basal area (*d**i**s**t**u**r**b*<sub>*i**n**t**e**n**s**i**t**y*</sub> in % of BA).

Design of experiment
--------------------

In order to assess the role of biodiversity in ecosystem answer to both disturbance and sylviculture, we needed to create a space of experiments encompassing both variation of disturbance and biodiversity. Disturbance was represented by percentage of basal area loss (0%, 25%, 50% and 75%), using default parameters. Biodiversity was integrated with two of its components: taxonomic and functional diversities. We used species richness *S**R* to represents taxonomic diversity (5, 25, and 125 species). Functional diversity can be related to numerous components, and Perrone *et al.* ([2017](#ref-Borgy2017)) argued for 5: richness, divergence, regularity, overlap and mean. Because mature forest were created from a bare soil with TROLL simulations, we could not control a priori divergence, regularity and overlap but only assess them after running the simulations, i.e. before applying the disturbance. Consequently, we focused on functional richness with convex hull volume *C**H**V* and functional mean with community weighted mean *C**W**M*. For each level of species richness *S**R*, we selected 20 communities with growing convex hull volume *C**H**V* but with a community weighted means close to the regional species pool community weighted means. Effectively, we did not wanted drastic change in community means that could have more effect than functional richness itself. This design of experiments resulted in 60 communities (3 *S**R* \* 20 *C**H**V*) and 240 simulations (60 *c**o**m**m**u**n**i**t**i**e**s* \* 4 *l**e**v**e**l**s* *o**f* *d**i**s**t**u**r**b**a**n**c**e*) over 600 years (maturity being assumed after 500 years of regeneration (Maréchaux & Chave [2017](#ref-Marechaux2017))). Functional diversities of mature forests were assessed with Villéger *et al.* ([2008](#ref-villeger_new_2008)) indices (FRIC, FEve, FDiv, and FDis).

Ecosystem response analysis
---------------------------

### Ecosystem functions

Tropical forest ecosystems provides numerous ecosystem services linked to several ecosystem functions. We decided to describe simulated tropical forests in two major functions: forest structure and forest functioning. Forest structure was represented by aboveground biomass (*A**G**B* in *t**o**n* *C*.*h**a*<sup>−1</sup>), basal area (*B**A* in *m*<sup>2</sup>.*h**a*<sup>−1</sup>), total number of stem (*N*), number of stem above 10 *c**m* diameter (*N*10), and number of stem above 30 *c**m* diameter (*N*30). Forest functioning was represented by growth primary productivity (*G**P**P* in *M**g**C*.*h**a*<sup>−1</sup>), net primary productivity (*N**P**P* in *M**g**C*.*h**a*<sup>−1</sup>), tree autotrophic respiration in day (*R**d**a**y* in *M**g**C*.*h**a*<sup>−1</sup>) and tree autotrophic respiration in night (*R**n**i**g**h**t* in *M**g**C*.*h**a*<sup>−1</sup>). Variables representing both forest functioning and forest structure are sometimes highly correlated within each group. But multiple variables allow a better assessment of ecosystem equilibrium.

The resilience of metrics values post disturbance were assessed through Henry & Emmanuel Ramirez-Marquez ([2012](#ref-Henry2012)) formula:

The resilience of the system *R*(*t*) at the time *t* is described by the ratio of recovery *R**e**c**o**v**e**r**y*(*t*) at time *t* to loss suffered *L**o**s**s*(*t*<sub>*d*</sub>) at disturbance time *t*<sub>*d*</sub>. But in our peculiar case of tropical forest ecosystems, the equilibrium used to calculate *L**o**s**s*(*t*<sub>*d*</sub>) can not be reduced to a specific time if the equilibrium is dynamic. Consequently, to encompass undisturbed ecosystem variations through time, we simulated an undisturbed control ecosystem *C*. And the resilience of the system *R*(*t*) at the time *t* was defined as the ratio of the ecosystem metric values in the disturbed simulation *X*<sub>*T*</sub>(*t*) over the ecosystem metric values from the control *X*<sub>*C*</sub>(*t*) (the control simulations being relatively stable due to a small stochasticity among TROLL simulations (Maréchaux & Chave [2017](#ref-Marechaux2017))). Thus, the value of resilience *R*(*t*) is normalized for all simulations and metrics. *R*(*t*) will be equal to *R*<sub>*e**q*</sub> = 1 when reaching the equilibrium value. Consequently we can calculate an euclidean distance to equilibrium *d*<sub>*e**q*</sub>(*t*) as $d\_{eq}(t) = \\sqrt{(R\_{eq} - R(t))^2}$. Ecosystem euclidean distance to equilibrium was calculated in a multi-dimensional space for the two functions described above: forest structure (AGB, BA, N, N10, and N30) and forest functioning (GPP, NPP, Rday, and Rnight). We then used integrated euclidean distance to equilibrium over time to assess simulations resilience.

We transformed all ecosystem outputs from the 240 disturbance simulations in resilience metrics normalizing the treatment values by their corresponding control (Figure @ref(fig:datatrans) A and B). We then gathered ecosystem outputs by main ecosystem functions (forest structure and forest functioning) to compute ecosystem distance to equilibrium (Figure @ref(fig:datatrans) C). Finally, we integrated distance to equilibrium in a cumulative sum over time (Figure @ref(fig:datatrans) D). The ranking of simulations regarding disturbance intensity was stable over time for the 240 simulations. So we used the cumulative integral after 600 years *I**e**q*<sub>600</sub> as a measurement of ecosystem resilience.

![Ecosystem outputs data transformation. Ecosystem outputs (**A**) are normalized by the control value over time to calculate resilience (**B**); resilience of different ecosystem outputs is then used in a multidimensional space to caluclate ecosystem distance to equilibrium (**C**); finally distance ot equilibirum is integrated over time in a cummulative sum (**D**).](draft_files/figure-markdown_github/datatrans-1.png)

### Biodiversity effect

Biodiversity is not only a facet of the experimental design and an ecosystem output through forest diversity, but also interact on ecosystem functioning and consequently on its answer to disturbance. Biodiversity ecosystem functioning relation can be split in complementarity and selection effect with Loreau & Hector ([2001](#ref-Loreau2001)) partitioning:

Biodiversity net effect *N**E* is based on the difference between ecosystem variable *X* observed value *X*<sub>*O*</sub> within the community mixture of species and its expected value *X*<sub>*E*</sub> if species performance were equal to their performance in monocultures. This effect can be partitioned between complementarity effect *C**E*, representing niche partitioning, positive interactions, and resource supply, and selective effect *S**E* due to dominant species pool driving the ecosystem. *N* represents the total number of species, and *M* the vector of monocultures performance. Both metrics depend on the variation of relative ecosystem variable *Δ**R**X*:

*X*<sub>*s**p*</sub> is the ecosystem variable value for one species either in mixture *X*<sub>*s**p*</sub>(*m**i**x**t**u**r**e*) or in monoculture *X*<sub>*s**p*</sub>(*m**o**n**o**c**u**l**t**u**r**e*). *P*<sub>*s**p*</sub> is the proportion of the species in the mixture represented by species relative abundance. Consequently, *C**E* averages diversity effects of all species presents in the mixture (both negatives and positives). Whereas *S**E* become positive when dominant species outperform themselves in mixture than in monoculture, and negative when less dominant species outperform themselves in mixture than in monoculture (Tobner *et al.* [2016](#ref-Tobner2016)). But similarly to resilience measurement, biodiversity net effect *N**E* is a dynamic equilibrium and vary over time without disturbance. So in order to correctly assess selection and complementarity effect in answer to disturbance, we normalized it by undisturbed control ecosystem net effect *N**E*<sub>*C*</sub> to measure treatments net effect resilience *R*(*N**E*<sub>*T*</sub>):

Resilience trajectories of ecosystem variable after disturbance were partitioned between complementarity effect *C**E* and selection effect *S**E*. In order to do that, the design of experiment was repeated for the each of the 163 species individually representing 652 simulations of monoculture.

Results

Ecosystem functions
-------------------

We compared cumulative integral after 600 years to communities taxonomic and functional diversity for each level of disturbance (see Figure @ref(fig:gIeq)). We found that increased functional diversity (FDiv, Villéger *et al.* [2008](#ref-villeger_new_2008)) was reducing cumulative integral from ecosystem distance to forest structure equilibrium after 600 years (*I**e**q*<sub>600</sub>). In addition, functional evenness was complementary reducing *I**e**q*<sub>600</sub>. Finally species richness was not directly link to *I**e**q*<sub>600</sub>. Effectively, low species richness could result in variant *I**e**q*<sub>600</sub>, but increased species richness resulted in increased functional diversity and consequently lower *I**e**q*<sub>600</sub>. We found similar results for all disturbance levels and forest functioning (see \[Appendix 5: Disturbance simulations\]).

Biodiversity effect
-------------------

We measured all ecosystem outputs biodiversity net effect in disturbance simulations by comparing them to their species corresponding monoculture simulations. The net effect was then partition between selection and complementarity effect. We normalized complementarity and selection effect of disturbed simulations by biodiversity net effect of undisturbed control simulation (see Table @ref(tab:tNE)) to measure the resilience of each ecosystem outputs, e.g. aboveground biomass (see Figure @ref(fig:gBE)). We found that complementarity effect was recovering biodiversity net effect on aboverground biomass and was stronger than selection effect in the first decades. But after few decades the complementarity effect diminished toward a low value. On the contrary selection effect was reduced or even removed by the disturbance. It increased during the whole simulation and was greater than complementarity effect only after decades. The time lag for which complementarity effect was greater than selection effect was increasing with disturbance intensity. Finally 600 years after the disturbance event biodiversity net effect on aboveground biomass was still not recovered for a disturbance intensity greater than 25% of basal area. We found similar results but with an amplified signal for basal area (*B**A*) and stem abundance (*N* but with an inverted signal because of the forest self thinning) (see Supplementary materials S2). Finally, forest growth primary productivity (*G**P**P*) recovered in few years (proportionally to disturbance), and its net effect was maintained by complementarity effect (see Supplementary materials S2).

Discussion
==========

In the limit of the model, we were able to show that diversity improved tropical forest resilience. More particularly, functional diversity and evenness are key components of diversity in forest recovery after disturbance. Moreover, we found that complementarity between species was insuring forest recovery in forest succession start with facilitation before more productive species dominate the forest and insure recovery. We thus advocate the view that both diversity theory (with niche complementarity and facilitation) and mass ratio theory (represented by selection) represents the mechanisms at the origin of functional diversity effect on ecosystem functions depending on the spatial scale and the time since the disturbance event.

Diversity improve tropical forest resilience
--------------------------------------------

Our results validated the hypothesis of a significative positive relationship between forest resilience and functional diversity and evenness (*p* &lt; 0.01 and *p* &lt; 0.05 respectively). Thus we were able to show that diversity improve forest resilience. More particularly, functional diversity (volume of the functional space occupied by the community, Villéger *et al.* [2008](#ref-villeger_new_2008)) seems a major aspect of resilience if its strengthened by a high functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume, Villéger *et al.* [2008](#ref-villeger_new_2008)). Indeed, high functional diversity needs evenness in order to better answer disturbance, if not the diversity is masked by ecosystem dominant species. Those results confirms the review of Díaz & Cabido ([2001](#ref-Diaz2001)) advocating for underevaluated importance of plant functional diversity in ecosystem processes. Additionally, the role of evenness confirm the review of Zhang *et al.* ([2012](#ref-Zhang2012)) who highlighted the role of evenness in productivity and thus resilience following our hypothesis. Finally, species and functional richness are not directly increasing resilience, thus supporting the idea that species diversity is often an inadequate surrogate of functional diversity (Díaz & Cabido [2001](#ref-Diaz2001); but see Poorter *et al.* [2015](#ref-Poorter2015)). Still, increased species and functional richness will increase chance for high functional diversity through the sampling effect (Loreau [1998](#ref-Loreau1998)). An higher sampling of regional species pool will allow a greater chance to pick more functionally diverse species.

Complementarity and selection insure forest resilience
------------------------------------------------------

We found that complementary effect was insuring forest resilience in the beginning of forest successions. We interpreted this results as the consequence of facilitation processes. As the only resource currently simulated by TROLL is the light, the main facilitation will be light shading of post-pioneer species by pioneer species in disturbance gaps. Our results confirm the study of Morin *et al.* ([2011](#ref-Morin2011)) who also highlighted the importance of facilitation through light shading in forest resilience. But the complementarity effect is reducing through time, to let the selection effect insure forest resilience due to an enforced dominance of more productive species. The diminishing of complementarity effect is attributed to competitive selection though time in gaps succession.

In addition, the study scale matters as shown by Chisholm *et al.* ([2013](#ref-Chisholm2013)) and Sullivan *et al.* ([2017](#ref-Sullivan2017)). Here we look at processes to a 16-ha scale. On the other hand, our simulation does not include topography resulting in the absence of microenvironmental variation affecting both water and nutrient availability. And studies suggest that complementarity will be stronger at smaller scale (Chisholm *et al.* [2013](#ref-Chisholm2013); Sullivan *et al.* [2017](#ref-Sullivan2017)), within plot itself (0.4-ha scale). This could explain the low value of complementarity after forest recovery. On the opposite, Sullivan *et al.* ([2017](#ref-Sullivan2017)) suggested that environment at larger scale could obscure the positive relationship between functional diversity and ecosystem functions and explain why the relation is detected at 0.4-ha scale and not at 1-ha scale. Consequently, the absence of topography and environmental heterogeneity in our simulations could be the reason why we still observed an effect to a 16-ha scale, strengthening Sullivan *et al.* ([2017](#ref-Sullivan2017)) interpretation.

Our results follows several studies advocating for multiple mechanisms through which functional diversity affect ecosystem functions. Complementarity effect encompass niche complementarity theory (or diversity theory), which has been shown to indirectly improve forest biomass and coarse wood productivity in subtropical forest (Chiang *et al.* [2016](#ref-Chiang2016)). Similarly, complementarity has been shown of primary importance in grassland functioning (Cardinale *et al.* [2007](#ref-Cardinale2007); Isbell *et al.* [2011](#ref-Isbell2011)). On the other hand, selection effect can be related to the mass ratio hypothesis, which proposes that ecosystem functions are regulated by dominant species of the community (Grime [1998](#ref-Grime1998)). And mass ratio theory has been shown to primarily influence ecosystem functions with biomass accumulation (aboveground and shoots), productivity (coarse wood or aboveground), water use, and light interception for both grassland and subtropical forests (Mokany *et al.* [2008](#ref-Mokany2008); Chiang *et al.* [2016](#ref-Chiang2016)). Consequently, concerning mechanisms responsible for the positive effect of functional diversity on tropical forest functions after disturbance, we also advocate for the interplay of both niche complementarity and mass ratio theories, depending on time since the disturbance event and the spatial scale.

Finally, our findings confirm results from experimental studies. Williams *et al.* ([2017](#ref-Williams2017)) also found experimentally an overyielding due to complementarity effect based on light and spatial complementarity with tree crown of young trees. In addition, Tobner *et al.* ([2016](#ref-Tobner2016)) studied 4-years stand in low diverse forests of Canada. They also found that selection effect was greater than complementarity in most of the cases, promoting the idea that mass ratio theory is the primary mechanisms involved in functional diversity effect on ecosystem functions (Mokany *et al.* [2008](#ref-Mokany2008)).

Conclusion
----------

We used closed forest system simulated with TROLL forest model to evaluate the role and mechanisms of biodiversity in tropical forest resilience to disturbance. We found that diversity improved forest resilience, similarly to productivity (Poorter *et al.* [2015](#ref-Poorter2015); Liang *et al.* [2016](#ref-Liang2016)). Additionally we found that complementarity between species was insuring forest recovery in forest succession start with facilitation, before more productive species dominate the forest and insure forest recovery.
