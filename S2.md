Ecosystem functions
===================

This appendix presents ecosystem resilience after 600 years with taxonomic and functional diversity for different levels of disturbance. It encompass all functionnal diversity components (FRIC, FEve, FDiv, and FDis, Villéger *et al.* [2008](#ref-villeger_new_2008)). And it presents results for both forest structure (Figure @ref(fig:A5IeqStructureAll)) and forest functionning (Figure @ref(fig:A5IeqProductionAll)).

Cummulative integral from ecosystem distance to forest structure equilibrium after 600 years was represented against functional diversity (FRIC, FEve, FDiv, and FDis, Villéger *et al.* [2008](#ref-villeger_new_2008)) for different level of disturbance (25, 50 and 75% of total basal area); dot shapes represents the species richness.](S2_files/figure-markdown_github/A5IeqStructureAll-1.png)

Biodiversity effect
===================

Figure @ref(fig:A5allBE) presents the resilience of complementarity and selection effects for different ecosystem metrics (AGB, BA, N, GPP and NPP).
